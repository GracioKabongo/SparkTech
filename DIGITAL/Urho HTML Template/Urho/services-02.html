                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-4">Web design is nothing more than creating the appearance of websites. The process is roughly the layout, design, and commissioning of your website. It is an interdisciplinary field that requires combining aesthetic sense, creative thinking and technical skills.</p>
                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-4">Web design has appeared quite recently. The first websites that were created in the early 90s were very simple. They consisted almost entirely of text. Due to the advancement of technology, photos and animations quickly appeared on them.</p>
                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-5">It was then that there was a need to professionally design websites in such a way that they were user-friendly and loaded as quickly as possible.</p>

                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-5">The real breakthrough came with the spread of smartphones. For some time now, the majority of website visits have come from mobile devices, and the phrase "next year will be the year of mobile" is so obvious that it has become the subject of jokes.</p>
                        <h2 class="h1 mb-4">Where to Start Learning?</h2>
                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-5">As we have already mentioned, web design is a field of computer graphics that combines many elements. What exactly will be necessary then?</p>
                        <h3 class="h2 mb-4">Basics of Drawing</h3>
                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-4">It is the basis for any activities related to visual arts. While you might think that the ability to use a pencil is not necessary with CGI, it is actually not the case.</p>
                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-4">Basic drawing skills in the case of web design will be useful at the beginning. The initial sketches of the page are usually made on paper. Besides, learning to draw is the first step to getting to know the basic principles of fine arts.</p>
                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-4">First, you will learn the rules of composition. The layout of the individual components of a drawing on a piece of paper will allow you to better plan the placement of elements on your website in the future.</p>

                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-4">It is the basis for any activities related to visual arts. While you might think that the ability to use a pencil is not necessary with CGI, it is actually not the case.</p>
                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-4">Basic drawing skills in the case of web design will be useful at the beginning. The initial sketches of the page are usually made on paper. Besides, learning to draw is the first step to getting to know the basic principles of fine arts.</p>
                        <p class="urho-lead-18 mb-4">First, you will learn the rules of composition. The layout of the individual components of a drawing on a piece of paper will allow you to better plan the placement of elements on your website in the future.</p>
